# Aircraft Operations policy

## Introduction

This document contains the policy governing the operation of aircraft
belonging to N132EA, LLC. Changes to this document may be made at any
time by a majority vote of the members. The most recent version of
this policy is always available at
[http://n132ea.haole-hapa.us/Operations.html](Operations).

## Pilot Requirements

1. Only members may act as Pilot In Command (PIC) of the aircraft. The
   only exception is dual instruction of members by non-member
   Certified Flight Instructors listed below.
1. Members who are CFI's may only instruct other members in the
   aircraft.
1. No one may act as PIC unless they are named in the aircraft
   insurance policy.
1. No one may operate an aircraft unless they can legally do so under
   the FARs.
1. Aircraft may only be operated under Part 91 and will not be used
   for air taxi, charter, or other commercial purposes.
1. Members who have flown less than X hours in the past Y months in
   the airplane type need a checkride with a Do we want to require
   some sort of currency?

#### Approved CFIs

The following (non-member) CFIs are allowed to conduct dual
instruction of members in LLC aircraft:

1. None

## Aircraft Scheduling

1. Aircraft scheduling is done on a first-come, first-served basis
   done through Google Calendar, and may be cancelled at any time.
1. There are no minimum or maximum limits on the time for which a
   member may schedule an aircraft, but members are expected to bear
   in mind that all members are entitled to equal access to the
   aircraft.
1. A member that plans to keep the aircraft away from the airport
   overnight is expected to accumulate at least 2 hours of flying time for
   each day the plane is away.
1. If a member will not utilize the aircraft as scheduled, the
   reservation should be cancelled as soon as this is known.
1. If a member is unable to return the aircraft before the end of
   their reservation, they should extend their reservation as soon as
   this is known. If the aircraft is already scheduled during that
   time, the next scheduled user must be notified. At all times,
   safety concerns should take precedence over scheduling.
1. Unplanned maintenance needs take precedence over scheduled use, and
   should be indicated on the schedule.

## Usage Fees

The current costs for each member are:

1. A monthly fee of $110, regardless of aircraft usage, to cover fixed
   costs.
1. An aircraft usage fee of $40 per hour of aircraft use, as measured
   by Hobbs meter. The hourly fee is ``wet'', i.e. costs of fuel, oil,
   and other consumables are paid for by the LLC. The hourly fee
   should be paid monthly or after 10 hours, whichever is sooner.
1. Members are solely responsible for landing fees, tiedown charges,
   etc., if they bring an airplane to another airport.

At ITO, fuel can be charged to the LLC's account with Air Service
Hawaii. At other airports, members can purchase fuel, oil, and other
consumables for later reimbursement. If the LLC has issued charge
cards to the members, these may also be used for this purpose.

## Operations

1. Operation must be conducted in accordance with the FARs and the POH
   for the respective aircraft.
1. The aircraft
   [aircraft issue tracker](https://github.com/lutorm/N132EA/issues)
   must be reviewed before each use of the aircraft.
1. The Hobbs start and stop time must be recorded in the aircraft log
   book. Any discrepancy between the start time and previous stop time
   should be noted as a separate entry and marked.
1. Do we want to require people to refuel after use or are there
   instances where people may not want full tanks for W\&B concerns?
1. Any problems must be noted in the
   [aircraft issue tracker](https://github.com/lutorm/N132EA/issues).
1. Engine oil level must be checked before each operation of the
   aircraft, and added as needed. A notation in the log book must be
   made whenever oil is added indicating the amount of oil added, the
   type of oil, the level prior to adding oil.

## Maintenance

1. Known aircraft maintenance and repair needs should be noted in the 
   [aircraft issue tracker](https://github.com/lutorm/N132EA/issues)
   and the issue closed when completed. Opening an issue will
   automatically notify all members.
1. Minor maintenance, up to a cost of $100, can be done directly by
   each member and charged to the LLC account.
1. It is expected that all members will help out with aircraft
   maintenance and repairs to keep labor costs minimal.
1. In the event of aircraft damage requiring replacement parts whose
   cost exceed the insurance deductible, the members will decide by
   majority vote whether to file an insurance claim or fund the repair
   with LLC funds.
1. A member will not be personally responsible for damage occuring
   while an aircraft was checked out by the member unless the flight
   was conducted in violation of this policy or the FARs.
1. Aircraft upgrades, such as additional equipment, that require
   additional capital contributions by the members shall be decided by
   unanimous vote.
